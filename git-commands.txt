1) git init
This command creates an empty Git repository - basically a .git directory with subdirectories.

2) git clone
Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches
for each branch in the cloned repository, and creates and checks out an initial branch that is
forked from the cloned repository’s currently active branch.

3) git add
It only adds the content of the specified file(s) at the time the add command is run.

4) git rm
Remove files from the index, or from the working tree and the index. git rm will not remove a
file from just your working directory.

5) git commit
The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository.

6) git status
Displays paths that have differences between the index file and the current HEAD commit, paths
that have differences between the working tree and the index file, and paths in the working tree
that are not tracked by Git.
